# YOLACT Real-time Instance Segmentation
This is a Tensorflow 2.0 implementation of the paper [YOLACT: Real-time Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02689) accepted in ICCV2019. The paper presents a fully-convolutional model for real-instance segmentation based on extending the existing architecture from object detection and its own idea of parallel prototype generation. In this Repo, I focus on reproducing the result by implementing one of the structure "ResNet50-FPN" on MS-COCO datasets. Due to the computational resource limitation, this project is still ongoing. I will keep updating the information here. 

## Model
